Role
You are an expert Machine Learning Engineer + Agricultural Domain Specialist.
Your task is to design and implement an ML-powered Crop Identification & Disease Detection system.

🔹 1. Objective

Build an ML system that:

Takes a crop image as input (captured via camera or uploaded)

Identifies:

Crop type

Disease (if any)

Cause of disease

Provides:

Natural (organic) cure

Chemical cure

Step-by-step prevention & recovery guidance

Outputs:

Confidence score (%)

Severity level (%)

This system must be explainable, practical, and farmer-usable.

🔹 2. Input

Primary input: Image of crop leaf / plant

Optional metadata:

Location (climate influence)

Crop age (if available)

🔹 3. ML Model Requirements

You may use:

Pretrained CNN / Vision models (e.g. ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet)

Fine-tuned crop-disease datasets (e.g. PlantVillage or equivalent)

Transfer learning is encouraged

Model responsibilities:

Crop classification

Disease classification

Severity estimation

Confidence scoring

The model must not be a black box — explain predictions.

🔹 4. Output Structure (MANDATORY)

The model must return a structured response like:

{
  "crop": "Tomato",
  "disease": "Early Blight",
  "confidence": 92,
  "severity": 68,
  "cause": [
    "High humidity",
    "Fungal infection",
    "Poor air circulation"
  ],
  "natural_solution": {
    "description": "Organic and eco-friendly methods",
    "steps": [
      "Remove infected leaves",
      "Apply neem oil spray every 7 days",
      "Improve air circulation"
    ]
  },
  "chemical_solution": {
    "description": "Faster chemical-based treatment",
    "steps": [
      "Apply recommended fungicide",
      "Follow dosage strictly",
      "Avoid spraying during noon"
    ]
  },
  "preventive_measures": [
    "Avoid overhead irrigation",
    "Maintain crop spacing",
    "Use disease-resistant seeds"
  ]
}

🔹 5. Explainability (VERY IMPORTANT)

For every prediction, explain:

Why this crop was identified

Why this disease was detected

Visual or feature-based reasoning (leaf spots, color, texture, etc.)

Farmer must understand the reason, not just the result.

🔹 6. UX Constraints (Model-Aware)

Output must be:

Simple language

Non-technical

Suitable for multilingual translation

Avoid medical / scientific jargon

Focus on actionable advice

🔹 7. Accuracy & Safety

If confidence < 70%:

Clearly say: “Prediction may not be fully accurate”

Suggest expert consultation

Never recommend unsafe chemical usage

Always include safety precautions

🔹 8. Scope Limitation (Important)

This module is:

❌ NOT full app

❌ NOT auth / dashboard

✅ ONLY crop → disease → solution ML pipeline

Design it so it can be plugged into any frontend/backend later.

🔹 9. Deliverables

Generate:

ML architecture

Model choice justification

Training & inference flow

API-ready prediction logic
